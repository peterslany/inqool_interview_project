## InQool interview project overview

This project is **responsive** implementation of [JS/TS Interview Project (React)](https://github.com/slavikdenis/jsts-interview-project).

You can see this project [deployed here](https://react-interview-project.netlify.app/), but routing there doesn't
work completely, because Netlify probably needs to be additionally configured.

## Running this project
You can run this project locally by cloning this repo and then running `npm i` in the project folder. 
After the packages are installed, run `npm start` in your terminal, the project will start running at localhost:3000.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Routing
You can search for the GitHub user by entering his username on page at `/search` and hitting search button 
or by entering URL `/user/USERNAME`, where USERNAME is the username you want to search for.

I used the React Context for the first time, I hope I set it up correctly.

## Technologies I used
 - React Hooks
 - React Context
 - React Router
 - Typescript
 - Ant Design
 - ESLint
